Recently, animal rights campaigners found that the source of the clothing firm’s supplier was in fact Hungarian farms where geese are artificially fattened in order to make pâte de foie gras from their oversized livers.

And a campaign by activists and celebrities is to be expected.                                                 www.telegraph.co.uk (August 28, 2012)d)Mikä vaateyritykseen liittyvä seikka on tullut ilmi, ja minkä reaktion se on aiheuttanut?Vad har avslöjats om klädfirman och vilken reaktion har avslöjandet haft?So you can make a pizza healthy…With sizzling pepperoni and oozing cheese slathered on an often greasy base, it doesn’t tick many boxes for the health-conscious.
