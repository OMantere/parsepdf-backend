The Mover and Shaker
On a typical day%2C Rachel Lichte%2C 31%2C wakes up to the smell of cooking 
fires and the sounds of the Muslim call to prayer. She makes a quick 
trip to town for supplies – tubes%2C wires – before heading to the three-
acre diamond mine%2C surrounded by pineapple plantations%2C where she 
oversees 51 male workers%2C including 16 security guards. There she 
spends her days “covered in dirt” and her nights poring over financial 
documents. As a cofounder of the jewelry company Clarity Project%2C 
she plans to use profits to enrich local communities.
Lichte’s interest in diamonds was awakened%2C atypically%2C by bananas. 
At 18%2C she backpacked through Costa Rica%2C where%2C she says%2C “I saw 
people working so hard on banana plantations but staying so poor.” 
Several years later%2C when friends started getting engaged and became 
interested in wedding rings with diamonds%2C Lichte suddenly realized 
the similarities between banana growers and diamond miners. Both 
groups of workers are poor and tend to remain so despite valuable 
local resources. She knew nothing about mining%2C but did know that 
consumers (like her friends who were conflicted about whether to buy 
diamonds at all) wanted stones “that aligned with their values.”
Initially%2C Clarity Project made rings with diamonds from a 
women’s mining co-operative in Lesotho. But then Lichte%2C who had 
previously held an office job in San Francisco%2C visited Sierra Leone 
to talk to miners and slowly earn the trust of local leaders (never 
mind her limited command of Krio%2C their language). After working 
to “navigate networks of influence%2C” heavily relying on the trust and 
relations she had managed to generate%2C Lichte started her own mine%2C 
the better to ensure fair treatment for workers. She now splits her time 
between Africa and the United States%2C sustaining social interaction 
between relevant interest groups and helping her designers plan a 
new jewelry line due out later this year. Lichte’s advice for those 
interested in getting ahead in the business world%3A “Start somewhere.

Just start. You’ll never have the perfect conditions. I assume no goal 
is unreachable. And I have the energy to put in a ton of work.”

Next%3A New Innovations
Some of the newest innovations in beach gear deal with safety%2C not 
style. To ward off lurking sharks%2C wearable deterrent devices that 
emit a small electrical field have surged in popularity. The device – 
worn around the ankle or embedded in suits – drives sharks away but 
does not harm them. Its electrical signals disturb small sensors in the 
shark’s snout that ordinarily detect the weak electrical field given off 
by living prey. The technology has been tested against species like 
blacktip and spinner sharks as well as the more dangerous great white. 
“Those are the ones we really want to protect against%2C” says biologist 
George Burgess. Still%2C research with large predators in the open ocean 
continues to bring challenges%2C not least of which is finding willing 
human test subjects.

Rural Issues%3A Generate Your Own Power
The challenges posed by rising fuel prices caused by the decreasing 
number of existing oil wells can be particularly acute in the lives of 
people living in rural areas. Fuel poverty lurks behind many remote 
and ancient rural properties which remain difficult to insulate. No 
wonder%2C then%2C that a growing number of rural communities are 
taking matters into their own hands. The UK Government’s recently 
published Community Energy Strategy estimates that there are at least 
5%2C000 such groups (both urban and rural) across the UK. Many start 
small – a heating oil club%2C for example (where members can buy in 
bulk and pay less)%2C or a project to improve the energy efficiency of a 
communal building – but increasingly groups are starting their own 
renewable power projects. Here’s how to follow their lead.
The most common model of community-generated energy is a 
village-owned renewable energy installation%2C such as a wind turbine 
or solar farm%2C which generates electricity and feeds it back into the 
National Grid via an energy company. Every kilowatt of power that 
1.1d
is generated earns money via Feed-In-Tariffs (FITs) – government 
subsidies to stimulate the take-up of renewables. This income can then 
be invested back into village projects. Renewable heat technologies%2C 
which enable communities to reduce their carbon footprint%2C incluThe challenges posed by rising fuel prices caused by the decreasing

slurry and silage into heat and electricity%2C are an emerging technology.
As for where to go for advice%2C there is no official channel of 
guidance in England%2C although the Community Energy Strategy%2C 
which projects that by 2020 more than a million homes could be 
powered by community energy%2C promises to offer a ‘one-stop-shop’ 
for information by early next year. Until that is available%2C the Energy 
Saving Trust’s website is an inspiring source of facts and case studies 
(accessible at est.org.uk). Local Energy Scotland provides free online 
advice on technologies and funding (localenergyscotland.org)%2C while 
in Wales the Ynni’r Fro programme has dedicated technical officers 
to give advice and make on-site visits (see est.org.uk%2Fcommunities).
The best way to get everyone on board involves working with the 
parish council and being as democratic as possible. This means using 
questionnaires and Neighbourhood Plans to assess the energy needs 
of local residents. It must be clear how income from the scheme will 
be spent%3A a biomass boiler for the school%2C for example. Renewable 
energy installations that benefit only landowners and shareholders are 
unlikely to win support from the wider community.

Reading Room
The opening sentence of Celeste Ng’s cleverly constructed%2C emotionally 
perceptive debut novel%2C 
Everything I Never Told You
 (The Penguin 
Press)%2C is characteristically unsparing%3A “Lydia is dead.” This stone-
cold statement creates immediate tension%2C not least because Lydia’s 
parents%2C James and Marilyn Lee%2C and siblings%2C Nath and Hannah%2C don’t 
yet know.
A few days into the search for the missing girl%2C Lydia’s body is 
found at the bottom of a lake – a discovery that shatters the Lees 
and causes a series of buried truths to surface. Ng’s narrative style 
1.1e
shifts back and forth in time and slowly reveals the discrete%2C hidden 
stories of family members. This type of writing offers clues to the 
central mystery by revealing only one detail at a time. This produces 
a creeping sense of dread that keeps the reader in its grip.
Ng sensitively dramatizes issues of gender and race that lie at the 
heart of the story. We learn how James%2C a son of Chinese immigrants%2C 
attempted to deny his roots – his parents%2C language and culture – to 
seek an American identity%2C and that Marilyn once abandoned both 
husband and children to follow her dream of becoming a doctor only 
to be set back by an unwanted third pregnancy. These plot lines come 
together in the character of Lydia%2C who is doomed to carry the burden 
of her parents’ ambitions and their desire to belong. Ng’s themes of 
assimilation are themselves cleverly twisted together into a gripping 
tale of ever deepening and quickening suspense.

Briefing – The Future of Universities
Universities face a new competitor in the form of massive open online 
courses%2C or MOOCs. These digitally-delivered courses%2C which teach 
students via the web or tablet apps%2C have big advantages%2C but online 
learning has its dangers. A pilot scheme at San Jose State University 
in California%2C offering a maths and statistics course run by Udacity%2C 
a for-profit co-founded by Sebastian Thrun%2C who taught an online 
computing course at Stanford%2C was discontinued last year. Whereas 
30% of campus students%2C with access to both academic and peer 
consultation%2C passed an entry-level algebra course%2C only 18% of those 
studying online did – and the gap widened as material became more 
complex. “MOOCs’ pedagogy needs to improve very quickly%2C” admits 
Udacity’s Mr Thrun. He thinks the San Jose experiment showed that%2C 
regardless of how motivated the students were%2C they needed more 
personalised support to use a university-level online course. 
Detractors point to high dropout rates%3A only about 10% of first-
time MOOC subscribers finish their course. That may not reflect 
badly on what is offered%3A the minimal cost of enrolment means that 
many people sign up without the firm intention to finish the course. 
But since the providers make most of their money from the fees of 
the certificates they grant to completers%2C maintaining a reasonable 
completion rate is important. Some are refining their courses to make 
the early stages easier to follow. 
In the meantime%2C a second generation of MOOC is trying to 
mirror courses offered at traditional universities. Georgia Institute of 
Technology and Udacity have joined forces with AT%26T%2C a telecoms 
firm%2C to create an online master’s degree in computing for %247%2C000%2C to 
run in parallel with a similar campus-based qualification that costs 
around %2425%2C000. Mona Mourshead%2C who runs McKinsey’s education 
consultancy%2C sees a turning point. “If employers are fine about this%2C the 
MOOC master’s degree will have taken off. Others will surely follow%2C” 
she says.
The universities least likely to lose out to online competitors are 
elite institutions with established reputations and low student-to-tutor 
ratios. That is good news for the American Ivy League and the UK 
Oxbridge and Co%2C which offer networking opportunities to students 
alongside a degree. Students at universities just below the Ivy League 
level are more sensitive to the rising cost of degrees%2C because the 
return on investment is smaller.
Since the first wave of massive open online courses launched 
in 2012%2C a backlash has focused on their failures and commercial 
uncertainties. Yet if critics think they are immune to the march of the 
MOOC%2C they are almost certainly wrong. Whereas online courses can 
quickly adjust their content and delivery mechanisms%2C universities are 
up against serious cost and efficiency problems%2C with little chance of 
taking more from the public purse.
In “The Idea of a University”%2C published in 1858%2C John Henry 
Newman%2C an English Catholic Cardinal%2C summarised the university as 
“a place for the communication and circulation of thought%2C by means 
of personal intercourse%2C through a wide extent of country”. This idea 
still inspires in the era when the options for personal intercourse via 
the internet are virtually limitless. But the Cardinal had a warning%3A 
without the personal touch%2C higher education could become “an 
icebound%2C petrified%2C stiff and stonelike%2C cast-iron university”. That is 
what the new wave of high-tech online courses should not become. 
But as an alternative to an overstretched%2C expensive model of higher 
education%2C they are more likely to prosper than fade.

Books and Arts%3A Singing
The first music that humans made was song. From the earliest known 
praise songs of the Sumerian king Culgi of Ur 3%2C000 years ago%2C 
singing voices have celebrated%2C seduced and bound tribes together. 
Yet this obvious truth cannot be proven. Until recorded technology 
arrived%2C hard evidence was limited to images of open mouths on walls 
and pots%2C and medieval singing manuals. Fortunately%2C this has not 
stopped musicologists from trying to sketch out a history of singing. 
In their 
History of Singing
 (Cambridge University Press)%2C John Potter 
and Neil Sorrell emphasize two main ideas. One is the absurdity of 
thinking of music as a “universal language”. Singing is culturally 
defined%3B what one group finds pleasing another will find unlistenable. 
The second thesis is more surprising. For most of history%2C song has 
been an improvisational%2C creative act. Music writers’ “ownership of 
the music”%2C enshrined in written scores%2C is recent and perhaps short-
lived. Opera%2C the grandest form of singing featuring written scores 
in the 19
th
 century%2C has long since died as the “living engine of vocal 
creativity”%2C the authors conclude. In the 21
st
 century%2C thanks to jazz%2C 
singer-songwriters and teenagers recording covers of their favourite 
songs with digital technology%2C humans may be returning to a mode of 
individual creativity that is the essence of singing.

The Beauty in London’s Beast
Yuen-Wei Chew%2C a 50-year-old financial consultant who lives in the 
Barbican%2C a Central London housing and arts complex%2C says that 
when he moved into the Barbican in 1994%2C it was viewed as a dreary 
undesirable place to live. Attitudes have been changing%2C though%2C and 
the more than 2%2C000 apartments at the Barbican estate are now in 
hot demand. The Barbican’s residents include some of the city’s top 
architects%2C academics and bankers%2C who moved there partly for its 
prime location in the financial district. Another part of the appeal%2C

Pity Britain’s technophobic arachnophobes. For while they will be 
trying desperately to trap the onslaught of autumn spiders in the age-
old way – fumbling around with a glass and a sheet of paper – the 
nation’s savvier spider-haters will be arming themselves with the most 
inventive of gadgets. Homewares chain Lakeland reported a sales 
boost of 140 per cent for its Spider Catcher gadget in just a week – 
and little wonder. Not only are customers preparing themselves for the 
annual spider season%2C but they are also reacting to news that the beasts 
are likely to be larger than ever. According to Professor Adam Hart of 
the University of Gloucestershire%2C we should be expecting spiders to 
be 3mm bigger than usual because the warm summer has furnished 
them with an abundance of insects to munch on. And as the cold 
nights draw in%2C the males will be venturing indoors in search of a mate. 
So don’t get caught out. Instead%2C take your pick from a dizzying array 
of – largely humane – devices designed to delicately dispose of our 
eight-legged friends%2C from vacuum tubes and glue traps to catching 
compartments and bristled claws.

2.1
For most students university remains 
a great deal%3B by one count the boost to 
lifetime income from 
__32__
 a college 
degree%2C in net-present-value terms%2C is as 
much as %24590%2C000. But for an increasing 
number of students who have 
__33__
deeply into debt – especially the 47% 
in America and 28% in Britain who do 
not complete their course – it is plainly 
not value for money. And the state’s 
willingness to pick 
__34__
 the slack 
is declining. In America%2C government 
funding per student fell by 27% between 
2007 and 2012%2C while average tuition 
fees%2C adjusted 
__35__
 inflation%2C rose by 
20%. In Britain tuition fees%2C close to zero 
two decades ago%2C can reach £9%2C000.
The second driver of change is the 
labour market. In the standard model of 
higher education%2C people go to university 
in their 20s%3A a degree is an entry ticket to 
the professional classes. But automation 
is beginning to have the same effect 
__36__
 white-collar jobs as it has 
__36__
 blue-collar ones. According to 
a study from Oxford University%2C 47% of 
occupations are 
__37__
 in the next few 
decades. As innovation wipes out some 
jobs and changes others%2C people will 
need to top 
__38__
 their human capital 
throughout their lives.

%2C these two forces would be 
driving change. A third – technology –

Commuter Science
By 8 a.m.%2C rush hour is at full throttle in 
most cities. Accidents%2C the cost of fuel%2C 
and the quality of public transportation 
aren’t the only factors that can make the 
drive to work 
__42__
 from boring to 
hellish. According to traffic analyst Jim 
Bak%2C there’s another thing that can cause 
commuting lengths to 
__43__
%3A the state 
of the economy.
“When the recession hit in 2008%2C 
congestion 
__44__
 the U.S. dropped 
30 per cent%2C” he says. Four years later%2C 
in 2012%2C drivers in Italy%2C France and 
Spain also spent less time on the road as 
unemployment%2C especially among youth%2C 
skyrocketed in the wake of Europe’s debt 
crisis. That same year%2C European Union

 the issue of land use is an 
idea that resonates with environmental 
geographer Paul Robbins. Turfgrass 
lawns are ecologically problematic 
because they keep other species from 
flourishing. “Nature hates a monoculture%2C” 
says Robbins. “Lawn maintenance is a 
desperate struggle against nature.”

Divided by a Common Language

people these days do not trust the government to oversee the provision 
of clean%2C fresh meat and fish and rely on themselves to provide the 
food. That way%2C they know what it is they are ingesting and how it was 
killed. Personally%2C I can’t stand trophy hunting%2Fpleasure hunting. It’s 
all about blood lust and making oneself feel on top%2C but if one wants 
to hunt game in order to provide food just like our great grandfathers 
and mothers did%2C then more power to them.
