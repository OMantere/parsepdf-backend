Nature’s City
Few cities if any can claim a closer connection to nature than Cape 
Town – South Africa’s Mother City. Full of vibrant and multicultural 
street life reflecting the fantastic colors and diversity of the flora and 
fauna surrounding the city center, Cape Town is unique in representing 
the world’s only city set entirely within a national park. As a World 
Heritage site with as much biodiversity as a tropical rain forest, Cape 
Town values and cherishes its extraordinary wildlife and truly lives 
in 
harmony with nature. For more information, visit

Genius Idea: Soup’s On
“There’s a fierce inventiveness to Detroit,” says artist Kaye Daughill. 
“People here take ownership of a problem and work to find solutions 
that improve residents’ lives.” In order to help Detroiters keep 
doing just this, Ms Daughill and a friend cofounded Detroit Soup, a 
philanthropic supper club. Each month four local groups present ideas 
to diners who pay $5 to attend; the attendees then discuss the ideas 
over soup, salad, bread, and pie, and decide which project will receive 
the evening’s proceeds. Since 2010 Detroit Soup has raised from $700 
to $1,000 per dinner for more than 20 community projects – such as 
a bicycle education workshop, or the design and manufacture of a 
coat for the homeless that converts to a sleeping bag – and the typical 
number of diners has grown from 20 to 200. “Right now in the current 
economic crisis Detroit in many ways feels like an underdog,” says 
Amy Kaherl, Detroit Soup’s current coordinator. “Someone needs to 
care for the city and its people, and that someone could be any one 
of us.”

A Fat Chance
Danish farmers, retailers and shoppers whooped with joy when the 
government announced the abolition of one of its most hated taxes: 
1.1
1.1a
1.1b
1.1c
a tariff on saturated fats, imposed just over a year ago. The tax was 
undoubtedly well intentioned. Higher prices for unhealthy foods 
would reduce consumption and improve public health; obesity levels 
and cardiovascular disease would fall; strains on health-care budgets 
would be eased.
Yet in practice, the world’s first fat tax proved to be a cumbersome 
and time-consuming chore with undesirable side effects. The tax’s 
advocates wanted to hit things like potato crisps and hot dogs, but the 
tax was also applied to high-end fare like speciality cheeses. Critics 
saw the tax as the worst excesses of a nanny state. Bakers fretted 
over the fat content of cupcakes. Pig farmers said their famous bacon 
would cost more than imports. This meant higher prices and lower 
sales.
Not everybody was happy to see the fat tax go. The Danish medical 
association accused politicians of putting the economy before public 
health. And even though some doctors acknowledged that the tax was 
a blunt instrument, they insisted that the time was too short to be able 
to gauge its significance. Unless and until sufficient data emerge, the 
effectiveness of the world’s first fat tax will remain buried under its 
own controversy.

From the Editor: Out of Bounds
It isn’t possible to pinpoint exactly who is most responsible for 
humankind’s best invention of all time. I am, of course, talking about 
science – the process that lets us test our assumptions, gather evidence 
and analyze the results. That process has propelled advances in basic 
research and practical applications for everything from extending our 
lives to expanding our physical and mental horizons.
Around the third century B.C.E. Aristotle and other ancient Greek 
philosophers put us on the right track, employing measurement to 
help learn about the world. Muslim scholars later pioneered the basics 
of testing and observation, the foundations of the scientific method, 
perhaps more than 1,000 years ago. Among the others who helped 
to refine the methods were Roger Bacon, who fostered the use of 
inductive reasoning in the 1200s; Galileo, who put Bacon’s ideas 
into practice in the late 1500s and early 1600s; and René Descartes, 
Francis Bacon and Isaac Newton, who built on the method shortly 
before and during the Enlightenment of the 1700s – to name a mere 
handful.
1.1d
In our single-topic issue, “Beyond the Limits of Science,” we 
celebrate just how far we have come as a species using that rational 
system. A series of apparent barriers now stands before us in our 
current 
life 
span: 
the 
physical 
body’s 
performance, 
individual 
intellectual capacity, engineering capabilities and even collective 
knowledge. How will we move past them? In this special edition, 
we provide a mind-expanding armchair journey to the edges – and 
beyond – of what is and will be possible.
For instance, in “Can We Keep Getting Smarter?” journalist 
Tim Folger writes about the Flynn effect, a kind of Moore’s law for 
measures of intelligence. In a world that prizes logic and abstraction, 
a positive feedback loop has led to our continuous progress in mental 
adaptation and the invention of new technologies. “How We All Will 
Live to Be 100,” by staff editor Katherine Harmon, examines efforts 
to lead longer, healthier lives by attacking our ancient enemies of 
illness and weakness. Casting aside the idea of mortality altogether, 
contributing editor Davide Castelvecchi describes “Questions for the 
Next Million Years” – research we could do if an individual’s career 
or life span were no obstacle.
As Sir Isaac Newton famously put it: “If I have seen further, it is 
by standing on the shoulders of giants.” Following his model, we can 
use the process of science to exceed today’s boundaries. Perhaps our 
only true limit is the human imagination itself.

Rolling Robo-Worm
Stop, drop, and roll. Firefighters teach this to kids, but, for some 
species of caterpillars, it’s a defense reflex. Confronted by a predator, 
the larvae spring into the air, assume a spiral shape, and hit the ground 
at top speed to wheel away from danger. The motion is thought to be 
one of the fastest wheeling behaviors in nature.
Hoping the technique will enable next-generation robots to go 
places that conventional crawling ones can’t, researchers at Tufts 
University have built a soft-bodied robot that imitates the spiraling 
actions of larval 
Pleuroptya ruralis
, a species from the UK. Made of 
silicone rubber, the robot’s four-inch-long body is under-girded by 
metal coils that contract into a circle when electrified, propelling the 
contraption forward at nearly eight inches a second. 
1.1e
As in nature, the ballistic rolling motion can send the body in 
whichever direction. However, says leading researcher Huai-Ti Lin, 
the robot’s ability to crawl or roll, depending on terrain, could one 
day have practical applications in environmental monitoring, building 
inspection, or even disaster search and rescue.

Material World
Damon Carson, 40, is a self-described tightwad. The tattered desk 
chair in his Denver office was pulled from a dumpster – a decade ago. 
He drives a used ’99 Chevy Silverado and wears thrift-store clothes. 
For several years, Carson ran a garbage company in the ritzy Colorado 
ski towns of Vail and Breckenridge, which regularly brought him to 
a local landfill. There he often saw brand-new windows and cabinets 
amid the rubble, and sometimes rescued these items from the pile. “It 
was heartbreaking to see perfectly good things about to be buried,” 
he says.
In 2010, eight years after Carson sold his trash company, an 
artist friend in the billboard industry just happened to mention that 
the massive ads, removed from their boards, made great drop cloths 
for painting. The wheels in Carson’s head began to turn. He found a 
few billboards for sale, and contacted friends in the agriculture and 
construction industries to see if they had any use for them. Thanks 
to his intervention, the billboards were reborn as tarps to cover hay 
and building materials. “We quickly ran out,” says Carson, who was 
so encouraged that he started reaching out to more industries – from 
bowling pin manufacturers to poultry farmers – to inquire about 
purchasing hard-to-recycle items.
Soon he’d founded Repurposed Materials, a company that turns 
would-be trash into valuable commodities. Torn-down billboards 
become pond liners, projection screens, even makeshift Slip ‘N 
Slides. 
Synthetic 
turf 
from 
football 
fields 
is 
refashioned 
into 
cushioning for egg-laying chickens. And when one customer intuited 
that street-sweepers’ brushes, stood on end, could be back scratchers 
for livestock, Carson sold two to the Bronx Zoo for its rhinoceros 
pen. “We’re helping industries pool their knowledge,” he says. “And 
our customers spend far less than they would buying similar products 
new.”
1.1f
As we speak, Carson spends his days devouring trade magazines 
and visiting businesses to examine what they’re throwing away. “This 
is my second foray into the waste stream of America,” he says with a 
laugh. “Round one, I was burying things in the landfill. Round two, 
I’m trying to keep them out.”

Haunting reads
More than 60 years after her death at Auschwitz, Irène Némirovsky 
found posthumous success with 
Suite Française
, which sold more than 
3 million copies in 2004. Now her first novel, 
The Misunderstanding
, is 
being reissued. Already displaying her major talent, this elegant book 
charts a universal topic by describing the tragic demise of a passionate 
relationship. The two novels are part of a planned sequence which was 
originally supposed to comprise five novels set in the occupied Paris 
where she lived at the time. In July 1942, having just completed the 
first two novels of the series, Ms Némirovsky was arrested as a Jew 
and transported to Pithiviers and then Auschwitz, where she died. The 
notebook containing the two novels was preserved by her daughters 
but not examined until 1998.

Grimm Tales: For Young and Old
The most striking feature of the fairy tales of the brothers Grimm is 
their anarchy. A creature in a tree, half-boy, half-hedgehog, plays the 
bagpipes, mounted on a cockerel. A golden bird takes wing with a 
chain in one claw, red slippers in the other, and a millstone around its 
neck. Beautiful or grotesque, the mad poetry of these tales is often 
delightfully funny too.
For the collection in this new book, Philip Pullman has translated 
50 of the best; old favourites such as “Hansel and Gretel” and “Snow 
White”, as well as many less well known. This collection is a real 
pleasure both to examine closely and browse through. Brevity and 
clarity, he says, were his guiding principles – to which he added wit 
and invention. A fairy tale is not a text, he explains. Rather, it is a 
transcription of something told and told again.
Mr Pullman insists these tales are stories first, not allegories. The 
Grimms first published their collection in 1812, having gathered them 
1.1g
1.1h
together from a variety of sources, some better than others. Those who 
read aloud will be heartened. This is the kind of writing that stands 
up to years of bedtime repetition. Not that bedtime is necessarily the 
best time to be exposed to it. Little boys have their heads chopped 
off (and stuck on again), dead men converse as they swing from the 
gallows, and bisected bodies drop down the chimney. But the stories 
bring comfort too. The wicked get their comeuppance, their due 
reward, and the starving their banquets. And, anyway, as Mr Pullman 
remarks, these are not people, as in novels, but cut-outs – flat, fixed 
and whizzing through their adventures.
In his introduction Mr Pullman explains that he aims to make 
the stories “as clear as water”. In this he succeeds, though here and 
there his own ironic presence is unmistakable. Mr Pullman’s best 
appearances are in the notes, which are often as entertaining as the 
stories themselves. The note to “Thousandfurs” even proposes another 
ending, a gruesome coda, an alternative ending, told with gusto, 
involving severed limbs. “I think that would work quite well,” Mr 
Pullman adds, deadpan – appearing to be serious.

British riots
In August 2011, a wave of riots engulfed England. Without warning 
or much apparent reason, public order and the rule of law collapsed. It 
all started in Tottenham, a multicultural area of North London, where 
the police stopped and shot dead a young black man in a series of 
raids on organised drug gangs. Over the next few nights, riots even 
1.2
spread to some other major cities, such as Birmingham, Liverpool and 
Manchester. There was arson, violence and looting, leaving behind 
a chaos unseen since the Second World War. What happened next? 
After nearly a week of national rioting, the teenage looters returned 
to hanging around the street corners and the shopping malls they’d 
just been smashing up. 
How did Britain respond? In the immediate aftermath of the 
disturbances, the airwaves were thick with the wisdom of politicians.  
Parliament was recalled – a measure normally reserved for wartime. 
There was much discussion but no action. The government set up 
a panel of inquiry, reaching conclusions as inoffensive as the riots 
were dramatic: poor parenting, lack of support for families, weak 
communities, lack of confidence in the police, materialism. However, 
“they” did do one thing: there was an enormous number of court 
trials, resulting in much more serious punishments than usual and 
much more quickly than usual.
How about the political conclusions? Left and right always read 
what they want into riots. Most people, though, don’t know what left 
and right mean anymore. After all, they live in an age in which the 
concept of class has disappeared from politics. Is it surprising then that 
the social glue sticks less well than it did; that the social order seems 
a much more random settlement than an ideal one? All in all, what is 
really remarkable is not that it happened but how dysfunctionally and 
ineffectually the British establishment reacted to it. You see, many still 
today yearn for the “golden” past. – Siôn Simon

Warm clothing
A popular American winter clothing company favoured by everyone 
from Barack Obama to BBC reporters had previously claimed that 
its down-filled coats were ethically produced. Recently, animal rights 
campaigners found that the source of the clothing firm’s supplier was 
in fact Hungarian farms where geese are artificially fattened in order 
to make pâte de foie gras from their oversized livers. For a long time,
the company had claimed that its source for goose down – the soft 
layer of feathers also used in pillows – was ethically sound and not the 
by-product of force-feeding. As a result of this revelation, consumers 
have already seen the French delicacy taken off the shelves at all major 
British supermarkets. And a campaign by activists and celebrities is to 
be expected.

was 
invented in 1909 and, with the exception of 
small quantities that have been consumed 
by fire, just about every piece of plastic 
__43__
 still exists in some form or other 
somewhere on the planet. In the UK we 
have begun recycling plastic, but that is 
an inefficient, energy-intensive process, 
only capturing a small percentage of the 
plastic we use daily. Much of the rest 
ends up in landfills. 
__44__
 attempt to 
deal with plastic will require us to take 
on 
the 
supermarkets, 
where 
virtually 
every purchase comes swathed in plastic. 
__45__
 the slogans, most supermarket 
chains have 
__46__
 refused to change 
their ways. What is required is political 
will: 
__47__
of 
the 
excessive 
use 
of 
plastic by the supermarkets or anyone 
else.
My third target would be to abolish 
factory farming. I more or less stopped 
eating meat two decades ago because 
I simply could not

__49__
 to abolish the crudest 
abuse in one country or even across the 
entire EU solves nothing, if supermarkets 
are allowed to carry on importing cheap 
meat from countries that handle their farm 
animals poorly. The only viable way is to 
ban the import of meat from countries 
that do not enforce decent standards. On 
second thoughts, why wouldn’t we all 
just turn into vegetarians? If we

The Eddystone
When a gale drives Henry Winstanley’s 
ship, 
Constant
, onto the Eddystone Rock 
in 1695, it’s too much. It’s the second 
ship Winstanley 
__1__
 to the rock in a 
year and he decides, 
__2__
, to erect a 
lighthouse. And 
__3__
 begins the story 
of an 
__4__
 wonder of the world.

The Eddystone 
__5__
 fifteen miles 
out to sea. 
__6__
, just one steep-sided, 
jagged rock is visible, ten paces wide. 
__7__
 anything in such a place is as 
ambitious, in the seventeenth century, 
__8__
 putting a man on the moon. 
__9__
to state control, no guiding precedents 
exist on how a lighthouse should look. 
Yet, 
__10__
, in 1698 a dim candle shines 
out from a sort of nautical gazebo. The 
following 
year 
Winstanley 
doubles 
its height, to over 100 
__11__
. It’s an 
immediate triumphant success. For five 
years no vessel wrecks on the Eddystone. 
__12__
, Winstanley boasts that his dearest 
wish is to witness, from his masterpiece, 
‘the greatest storm there ever was.’ Fate 
brutally complies, and he is there on the 
night of the Great Storm of 1703. 
__13__
remains of the tower and Winstanley are a 
few 
__14__
 lumps of iron. Two days later, 
the Eddystone 
__15__
 its next ship.

Does Finland give back?
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(
OECD
) lists countries by the amount of money they give to 
development assistance as a percentage of their gross national 
product
(see Table 1 below). Discuss the aid in light of these 
figures comparing Finland’s contribution with that of a few other 
countries. Is Finland giving enough to poor people in foreign 
countries? Give grounds for your opinions.
